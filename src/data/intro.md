I’m a software engineer driven by a fascination with how systems work "under the hood." For most of my career, I’ve focused on building secure, resilient backend services. However, my deep roots in the open-source community have given me the unique opportunity to contribute to large-scale, universally used software beyond traditional backend roles. I am a firm believer in the power of open-source collaboration and community-driven development.

Currently, I’m channeling my love for systems engineering into the world of blockchain, exploring the intersection of low-level architecture and decentralized tech.

When I’m not at the terminal, I am often out practicing **photography** 📸, lost in a good book 📚, or deep-researching historical events.

<!-- Recently, I worked on the <a class='text-default' href="https://crates.io/crates/plunk"> Plunk Rust SDK </a> 🦀  now the official community SDK featured in
<a class='text-default' href="https://docs.useplunk.com/guides/rust-sdk"> Plunk's documentation </a>. I’m also building an unofficial SDK for <a class='text-default' href='https://polar.sh' > Polar.sh </a> ❄️, both aimed at improving the open-source dev experience.

And also, I am currently building <a class='text-default' href="https://www.ourpocket.xyz/">OurPocket</a> -->
