I’m a software engineer driven by a fascination with how systems work "under the hood." For most of my career, I’ve focused on building secure, resilient backend services. However, my deep roots in the open-source community have given me the unique opportunity to contribute to large-scale, universally used software beyond traditional backend roles. I am a firm believer in the power of open-source collaboration and community-driven development.

My technical foundation is built on solid experience with Linux and its vast ecosystem. In the past, I spent significant time experimenting with various distributions—often on my primary machine. While "distro-hopping" on my daily driver led to a few "burnt" systems and hard lessons, it was an invaluable experience that taught me how to troubleshoot, recover, and truly understand the OS layer.

<br/>

Opensource and community leadership has also been a core part of my journey. I served as the Lead for the **Google Developer Student Club (now GDG on Campus)** at my university from 2022 to 2023, where I was responsible for organizing technical events and managing our member base. 

Later, I was selected as an Outreachy intern for the **GNOME Foundation (2024–2025)**. During the internship, I worked on <a class='text-default font-semibold' href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/librsvg">Librsvg</a> a project I remain an active contributor to while also engaging with the community's infrastructure engineering.

<br/>

Currently, I am diving deep into the world of **Blockchain Engineering**. I’m fascinated by the intersection of low-level architecture and decentralized technology at the protocol level. This involves mastering distributed systems, consensus algorithms, and smart contract development—skills that are not only challenging but highly transferable across the engineering landscape.

When I am not geeking as an engineer, I am often out practicing **photography** 📸, lost in a good book 📚, or deep-researching historical events and I have quite the perspective on history and current related events that I find interesting and might find myself sharing on my <a class='text-default font-semibold' href="/articles/non-technical">non-technical</a> posts.

I’ll leave you with one of my favorite lyrics from the song <a class='text-default font-semibold' href="https://youtu.be/oh0vj_eKHeE?si=KFKCMRM13zdZ3qr6">Survivor's guilt</a> by Dave

<br/>

**"when you feel like givin' up, know you're close"**.
